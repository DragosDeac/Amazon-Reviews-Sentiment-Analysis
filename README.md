# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

Welcome to my project on sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews! 
This project uses machine learning to determine whether reviews are positive or negative. It's designed to show how we can use modern tools to make sense of large amounts of text data.

**Key Features:**
  Sentiment Analysis: Classify Amazon reviews as positive or negative.
  Pre-trained Models: Use models from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
  Data Visualization: Visualize the results to understand the sentiment trends.
  
**Project Steps:**
  Data Loading: We start by loading the Amazon reviews dataset.
  Text Cleaning: Prepare the text data by removing unnecessary parts and formatting it correctly.
  Sentiment Prediction: Use a pre-trained model to predict the sentiment of each review.
  Results Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the distribution of sentiments.
  
**Tools Used:**
  Python, with the following:
    Pandas: For data manipulation.
    NLTK: For text processing.
    Transformers: For the pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
    Jupyter Notebook: Where the project is developed and run.
    
**How to Run the Project:**
  Set Up: Make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.
  Execute: Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see the data processing, sentiment analysis, and visualizations.

Project was developed using keggle.
